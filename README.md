# This is the 18.04 version of Dash Green

Copy and paste the following command into your VPS

```
wget https://github.com/Paulie-Q/dashgreen/raw/master/dashgreen-cli && wget https://github.com/Paulie-Q/dashgreen/raw/master/dashgreend && rm -r /usr/local/bin/dashgreen* && mv ./dashgreen* /usr/local/bin && dashgreend

This will get your VPS updated to the version compiled on 18.04 and will start the daemon.
